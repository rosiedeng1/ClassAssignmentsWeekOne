# <Marketing Agency Website>

## Description

This project was created to edit the contents of a Marketing Agency website so that it can be easily understood/have a concise, accessible version. This includes modified parts of the HTML/CSS code. It solves the problem of functionality/so anyone can understand it. I learned a lot about semantic HTMLs and consildating the CSS selectors. The actual website is meant for people who need help with their business and how to help it be successful.
