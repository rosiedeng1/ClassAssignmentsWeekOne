# <Marketing Agency Website>

## Description

This project was created to edit the code (html and css parts) of a Marketing Agency website (Horiseon) so that 
it can be organized to be easily understood and have a concise, accessible version. This includes modified parts of the HTML/CSS code. It solves the problem of organizing everything into a logical structure and functionality so anyone can understand what is happening in each part of the website. I learned a lot about semantic HTML elements, the proper structure of a webpage, and things like consildating the CSS selectors. The actual website is meant for people who need help with their business and how to help it be successful.

## Usage

This website can be used by clicking on a link at the top, which goes to the corresponding topic (online reputation management, search engine optimization, and social media marketing) and reading the description. If you inspect the HTML and CSS page, you can see that it follows a concise and logical format.
